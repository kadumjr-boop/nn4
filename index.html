Why exercise?

Exercise is important for your body in many ways. First of all,
exercise builds muscles. You need strong muscles to do all the
things you want to do during the day, even if your favourite hobby
is playing computer games. If your muscles aren’'t strong, you can
get tired easily.

Did you know yvour heart is a muscle? That's why exercise is good
for your heart, too. A strong heart can help prevent heart disease,
This illness kills many people in developed countries because they
don't have healthy habits. The best activities for your heart are
activities like running that make you breathe hard.

Exercise is good for wyou because it helps you use the calories you
get from food. If you don’'t exercise enough, the calories you don't
use can make you fat. And people who are overweight are generally
not as healthy as those who are not.

The best reason to get exercise is that it's fun, If you enjoy
being with other people, try playing basketball or volleyball. Team
sports are a good way to make friends and have fun while you get
fit. But you don’t have to do a sport to get exercise. Try walking

or taking the stairs. These activities don’t take much time, but if
you do them regularly, they can help you get fit,

3 How does exercise keep you slim?

Saturn is a giant planet. Second only to Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system,
Safurn is fen fimes as wide as Earth, Unlike Earth, it is not a rocky planet but is made
mainty of gases.

When people think of Saturn, they think of its rings. The rings were first seen in 1610.
Al the time. telescopes were not very strong and the rings were not very clear. Today,
if you look through a modern felescope, you will see that Saturn has hundreds of
rings. They are mostly made of ice, although some confain small rocks.

Several spacecraft have visited Saturn. The first three visits were by Pioneer |l in 197
Voyager 1 in 1980 and Voyager 2 in 1981, Today, the spacecraft Cassini is visiting
Saturn. Cassint is sending back pictures of Saturm’s rings and moons. Saturn has over
40 moons, many of them very small. Most of them orbit Saturn af the edge of the rings,
but pictures from Cassini have shown us that at least two small moons orbit inside
Saturn's rings. Cassini is alse sending back o lot of pictures of Saturn's largest moon,
Titan. Scientists hope these pictures will help them understand how Titan was formed.
